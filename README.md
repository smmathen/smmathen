- 👋 Howdy, I'm Shawn!
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. I like to use my programming abilities to create personal projects and my personal website (smmathen.github.io) (custom domain coming soon 😅)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end developement and data science in my free time, and C++, Java, and Haskell in my college courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn anything since I'm still relatively new to programming, and I am excited for the unlimited possibilities in what I can build.
