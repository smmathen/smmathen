# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Shawn!
## I am passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems and makes people's lives easier. I enjoy working on personal projects as a way to explore new technologies and challenge myself. Here's a bit more about who I am and what I do:

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in software development, particularly backend development and machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning all sorts of new tech in my free time, from mobile dev to machine learning to computer-human interaction.
- ðŸ“š I'm always looking to learn new things since I'm still relatively new to programming. I'm excited about the unlimited possibilities of what I can build.

You can check out my personal website [here](https://shawnmathen.me/) to see some of my projects. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-mathen) to chat about all things software development (or if you want to talk about anything else).
