# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Shawn!
## I am passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems and makes people's lives easier. I enjoy working on personal projects as a way to explore new technologies and challenge myself. 

You can check out my personal website [here](https://shawnmathen.me/) to see some of my projects. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawn-mathen) to chat about all things software development (or if you want to talk about anything else).

Most of my current projects are done at work, which is not reflected here. If you are curious, feel free to reach out and we can discuss that work.
